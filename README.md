# Celestial-Jungle-Soup

A 2D top-down game made in Unity.
So far the player can select one of 31 characters to play as, and each character gets 4 abilities (right-click, left-click, shift, and spacebar). Currently, there are no NPC's, but the game is online multiplayer, so we just have PVP right now. In the future I plan on creating levels, NPC's, and monsters, so players can work together to complete adventures, travel through dungeons, complete mazes, fight bosses, and solve puzzles. Very ambitious!
